# In an N by N square grid, each cell is either empty (0) or blocked (1).

# A clear path from top-left to bottom-right has length k if and only if it is composed of cells C_1, C_2, ..., C_k such that:

#     Adjacent cells C_i and C_{i+1} are connected 8-directionally (ie., they are different and share an edge or corner)
#     C_1 is at location (0, 0) (ie. has value grid[0][0])
#     C_k is at location (N-1, N-1) (ie. has value grid[N-1][N-1])
#     If C_i is located at (r, c), then grid[r][c] is empty (ie. grid[r][c] == 0).

# Return the length of the shortest such clear path from top-left to bottom-right.  If such a path does not exist, return -1.

# Example 1:
# Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
# Output: 2

# Example 2:
# Input: [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
# Output: 4


# Note:

#     1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100
#     grid[r][c] is 0 or 1
